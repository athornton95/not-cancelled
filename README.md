# not-cancelled
Welcome to #notcancelled! A data base of quarantine appropriate activies to keep you happy
and healthy throughout the current pandemic crisis (and beyond).

Using #notcancelled, you can decide whether you want to stay inside or outside. 
Inside: produced a movie database sorted by genre that then returns a list of movies to watch based on your chosen genre.
Outside: you get to go on a hike! Far away from other people (or atleast 6 feet please). Enter your current location and your
hiking preferences and #notcancelled will return to you a curated list of hikes in your area.

I would love to expand past these two activies, and plan on doing so! 
But for now, watch a movie or take a hike because both of those activies are #notcancelled.
